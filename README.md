# ferminet - Fermionic Neural Network
I wrote this library for my internship at TUM. It reproduces the results of [Pfau et al. (2020)](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.033429 "Ab initio solution of the many-electron Schr√∂dinger equation with deep neural networks"), which trains so-called Fermionic Neural Network to find the ground state wave functions of an atom or a molecule using neural network quantum states, see [Carleo and Troyer (2017)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aag2302 "Solving the quantum many-body problem with artificial neural networks").

## Usage
Here is an example for a Lithium atom.
```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
import optax

from ferminet_tum.atom import Atom
from ferminet_tum.network import FermiNet
from ferminet_tum.hamiltonian import Hamiltonian
from ferminet_tum.sampler import Sampler
from ferminet_tum.driver import NNQS

li_atom = [Atom(id="Li", pos=jnp.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0]))]
n_electrons = [2, 1]  # number of up- and down-spin electrons

n_1 = [32, 32, 32]  # numbers of hidden units for the one-electron stream
n_2 = [16, 16, 16]  # numbers of hidden units for the two-electron stream
n_k = 16  # number of many-electron determinants
L = len(n_1)  # number of layers

# initialize the FermiNet
fn = FermiNet(
    li_atom,
    n_electrons,
    L,
    n_k,
    n_1,
    n_2,
)
params = fn.init_params()  # initialize the parameters

# initialize the Hamiltonian
hamiltonian = Hamiltonian(fn)

n_step = 10  # number of steps in each sampling
step_std_per_dim = (
    0.02  # standard deviation of the Gaussian noise in each step for each dimension
)

# initalize the sampler
sampler = Sampler(fn, n_step, step_std_per_dim)

n_samples = 4096 # number of samples

# initialize the driver
nnqs = NNQS(sampler, hamiltonian, fn, n_samples)

n_iters = 1000  # number of iterations

# training the network
params, energies = nnqs.train(n_iters, params, optax.adam(learning_rate=1e-3), -7.47798)
